# Robotics Learning Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you through the essential concepts and practical skills needed to master robotics using simulations. Follow the steps below for a structured learning experience.

## 1. Introduction to Robotics

### What is robotics?
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, engineering, and technology to design, build, operate, and use robots. Robots are programmable machines capable of carrying out a series of actions autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics involves both the physical construction of robots and the development of algorithms that control their behavior.

### Types of robots
Robots come in many forms, each designed for specific tasks or environments. Common types include:
- **Industrial robots**: Used in manufacturing for tasks like welding, assembly, and painting.
- **Mobile robots**: Robots that move through their environment, such as autonomous vehicles and drones.
- **Humanoid robots**: Robots with a human-like appearance, designed for research, assistance, or entertainment.
- **Swarm robots**: Multiple simple robots working together to achieve complex tasks.
- **Service robots**: Used in healthcare, hospitality, cleaning, and other service industries.

### Applications of robotics
Robotics is used in a wide range of industries and research areas, including:
- **Manufacturing and automation**: Increasing efficiency and safety in factories.
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, rehabilitation, and assistive devices.
- **Exploration**: Space, underwater, and hazardous environment exploration.
- **Agriculture**: Automated planting, harvesting, and monitoring.
- **Logistics and delivery**: Warehouse automation and last-mile delivery robots.
- **Education and research**: Teaching STEM concepts and advancing robotics technology.

## 6. Sensor Fusion

### What is Sensor Fusion?
Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate, reliable, or comprehensive information than could be achieved by using a single sensor alone. In robotics, sensor fusion is essential for robust perception, localization, and control, as it helps mitigate the limitations and noise of individual sensors.

#### Why is Sensor Fusion Important?
- **Redundancy:** If one sensor fails or is noisy, others can compensate.
- **Complementary Information:** Different sensors provide different types of data (e.g., IMU for motion, GPS for position, LIDAR for distance).
- **Improved Accuracy:** Fusing data can reduce uncertainty and error.
- **Robustness:** The robot can operate reliably in more challenging or dynamic environments.

#### Common Sensor Fusion Applications in Robotics
- **Localization:** Combining wheel encoders, IMU, GPS, and vision to estimate a robot's position.
- **Mapping:** Fusing LIDAR and camera data to build accurate maps.
- **Navigation:** Integrating multiple sensors for obstacle avoidance and path planning.
- **Attitude Estimation:** Using accelerometers and gyroscopes to estimate orientation (e.g., complementary filter, Kalman filter).

#### Sensor Fusion Techniques
- **Complementary Filter:** Simple, fast, and effective for combining two sensors with different noise characteristics (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope).
- **Kalman Filter:** A probabilistic approach for optimal estimation, widely used for sensor fusion in robotics.
- **Particle Filter:** Used for non-linear, non-Gaussian problems, such as robot localization.
