# Robotics Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the Robotics Learning Roadmap! This site provides a structured path for learning robotics, from fundamental theory to hands-on projects.

## Index

1.  **[Theory](theory.md)**
    *   Get started with the foundational concepts of robotics, including kinematics, dynamics, and environment setup.

2.  **[Sensor Fusion](sensor_fusion/README.md)**
    *   Learn how to combine data from multiple sensors to get a more accurate understanding of the environment. Includes a practical demo with a complementary filter.

3.  **Swarm Robotics**
    *   *(Coming Soon)*

4.  **[Computer Vision for Robotics](computer_vision/README.md)**
    *   *(Coming Soon)*

5.  **[Physical Computing](physical_computing/README.md)**
    *   *(Coming Soon)*

6.  **[CAD for Robotics](cad/README.md)**
    *   *(Coming Soon)*

7.  **[EDA for Robotics](eda/README.md)**
    *   *(Coming Soon)*

8.  **More Coming Soon...**
