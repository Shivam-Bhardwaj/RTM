# Theory

This section covers the foundational theory for robotics, as outlined in the roadmap.

## 1. Introduction to Robotics

### What is robotics?
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, engineering, and technology to design, build, operate, and use robots. Robots are programmable machines capable of carrying out a series of actions autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics involves both the physical construction of robots and the development of algorithms that control their behavior.

### Types of robots
Robots come in many forms, each designed for specific tasks or environments. Common types include:
- **Industrial robots**: Used in manufacturing for tasks like welding, assembly, and painting.
- **Mobile robots**: Robots that move through their environment, such as autonomous vehicles and drones.
- **Humanoid robots**: Robots with a human-like appearance, designed for research, assistance, or entertainment.
- **Swarm robots**: Multiple simple robots working together to achieve complex tasks.
- **Service robots**: Used in healthcare, hospitality, cleaning, and other service industries.

### Applications of robotics
Robotics is used in a wide range of industries and research areas, including:
- **Manufacturing and automation**: Increasing efficiency and safety in factories.
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, rehabilitation, and assistive devices.
- **Exploration**: Space, underwater, and hazardous environment exploration.
- **Agriculture**: Automated planting, harvesting, and monitoring.
- **Logistics and delivery**: Warehouse automation and last-mile delivery robots.
- **Education and research**: Teaching STEM concepts and advancing robotics technology.

## 2. Setting Up Your Environment
- Installing Python and required libraries
- Introduction to robotics simulators (e.g., Gazebo, Webots, V-REP/CoppeliaSim)
- Setting up your first simulation

## 3. Robot Kinematics and Dynamics
- Forward and inverse kinematics
- Differential drive and holonomic robots
- Simulating robot motion
