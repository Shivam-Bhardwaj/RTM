# Robotics Learning Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you through the essential concepts and practical skills needed to master robotics using simulations. Follow the steps below for a structured learning experience.

## 1. Introduction to Robotics

### What is robotics?
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, engineering, and technology to design, build, operate, and use robots. Robots are programmable machines capable of carrying out a series of actions autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics involves both the physical construction of robots and the development of algorithms that control their behavior.

### Types of robots
Robots come in many forms, each designed for specific tasks or environments. Common types include:
- **Industrial robots**: Used in manufacturing for tasks like welding, assembly, and painting.
- **Mobile robots**: Robots that move through their environment, such as autonomous vehicles and drones.
- **Humanoid robots**: Robots with a human-like appearance, designed for research, assistance, or entertainment.
- **Swarm robots**: Multiple simple robots working together to achieve complex tasks.
- **Service robots**: Used in healthcare, hospitality, cleaning, and other service industries.

### Applications of robotics
Robotics is used in a wide range of industries and research areas, including:
- **Manufacturing and automation**: Increasing efficiency and safety in factories.
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, rehabilitation, and assistive devices.
- **Exploration**: Space, underwater, and hazardous environment exploration.
- **Agriculture**: Automated planting, harvesting, and monitoring.
- **Logistics and delivery**: Warehouse automation and last-mile delivery robots.
- **Education and research**: Teaching STEM concepts and advancing robotics technology.
